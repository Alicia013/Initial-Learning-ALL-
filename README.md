# Initial-Learning-ALL

Brand new to code and excited to start this journey. Currently, I've been a Sales Professioanl for 13 years, now ready for the leap into technology. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities and the ever changing, continuous growth and learning it has to offer. My end goal, at this time in my journey is Cyber Security. However, given the many paths ahead, who knows where I'll end up.
